# City UI Application

This React application, built with Material-UI (MUI), serves as a user interface for managing city data. The application features a single-page layout with a responsive design, showcasing a table populated with city information, such as name, area, population, and density, obtained via a REST API (https://github.com/GeorgiYankov00/city-api). The UI supports the following functionalities:
* Filter cities by a partial name or full name
* Perform server-side pagination and sorting
* Create new city
* Enable/Disable columns from the supported ones - name, area, population, and density
* Adjust row density
* Export filtered data into a CSV file
* Present the total count of cities loaded into the system
